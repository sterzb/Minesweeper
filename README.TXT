PROJECT TITLE: Minesweeper
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Class Project   
VERSION or DATE: Version 3.2.11
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run Gamemain()
AUTHORS:Ben Sterzinger 
USER INSTRUCTIONS:  Choose Board size then Choose number of randomly placed mines. Board will be drawn then the 
mines will be placed.  If the user chooses a number that cannot be chosen, an exception is thrown.  Mines are stored in the tile array. There is a minor bug in array position identification, however the score does score and add up correctly in test cases.  Player information will be stored locally in players.csv.
First, last, and Email are the entered values.  The program does operate correctly in the command line environment but there were a few issues
going to scenebuilder, including the fact I could not get scenebuilder to work until I recieved help from my former professor at Trident Tech due to the 
unavailability of assistance with this.


please regrade the first project presentation with the UML diagram.
